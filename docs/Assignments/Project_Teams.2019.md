# Project topics suggestions

## Team Microbiome

1. Develop analysis pipeline to process Microbiome data from a published
study. Focus on existing clustered "OTUs" already not the first steps

2. Metagenome analyses. Take existing, published metagenomes and compare
abundance of specific enzymes classes between the two.

## Team Gene

1. Use a genome annotation of a set of species (plants, microbes might
be best) to compare the differences in gene lengths, intron lengths,
Untranslated lengths across the species. This is generating sumamry statistics about annotated genes.

## Team Transcriptome

1. Identify a published RNAseq dataset for at least 2 conditions with
replicate. Process the RNAseq to identify gene expression differences
and identify if there are different functional classes of genes found
in genes which are up or down regulated.


## Team Proteins

1. Compare the protein content among sets of organisms. For example,
Can develop a classifier for outlier proteins and/or ecological
adaptations (thermophillic vs halophillic).

2. Examine the differences in Protein domain distribution between species.

## Team Russian Doll

1. Many organisms have undetect symbionts of bacteria or
viruses. Develop an analysis to look at sets of either assembled or
unassembled bacteria to look for associated viruses (bacteria
phage). Or develop a pipeline too look at assembled eukaryotic genomes
and detect bacteria in the genome assemblies.
